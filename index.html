        <b>Kyoto (京都, Kyōto) </b>is Japan’s oldest city and served as the nation’s capital and the emperor’s residence for over
        1,000 years, from 794 until 1868. Over the centuries, the city has been destroyed by many wars and fires,
        however, because of its cultural and historical value Kyoto was largely spared by the WWII bombings. It is for
        this reason that you can still visit many old cultural landmarks and historical sites. And because of the
        preserved townscape, you will find many people walking around in a  (traditional Japanese
        clothing) in Kyoto! If you want to try on a kimono and explore the city, you can easily find some kimono rental
        shops in Kyoto to complete the look to match the historical sites

        <b><u><i>Present day, Kyoto is home to about 2,000 temples and shrines such as the Fushimi-Inari Shrine, the Kinkaku-ji
        (The Golden Pavilion), and Kiyomizu-dera Temple. Some of Kyoto’s other famous tourist destinations include the
        Imperial Palace and the Gion district.</i></u></b>

        Kyoto is often combined with day trips to some of <strong> Japan’s famous tourist destinations </strong> that are located nearby,
